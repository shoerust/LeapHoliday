LeapHoliday
===========

A very simple Processing application for controlling a <a href="http://moorescloud.com/">Holiday</a> by <a href="https://github.com/moorescloud/">MooresCloud</a> with a LeapMotion controller.

If you don't have Processing, you can download it <a href="http://www.processing.org/download/">here</a>. You'll need to change the IP address/name of your Holiday in the code. I hope to add some sort of search mechanism soon.

This application uses the Java library <a href="https://github.com/mrzl/LeapMotionP5">LeapMotionP5</a>.
