LeapHoliday
===========

A simple Processing application for controlling a Holiday by MooresCloud with a LeapMotion controller.
This application uses the Java library LeapMotionP5, also available on GitHub https://github.com/mrzl/LeapMotionP5.
Eventually I'll extract this code out into a standard Java application.
